    abstract = "{The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on antimicrobial use (AU) and resistance has not been well evaluated in South America. These data are critical to inform national policies and clinical care.At a tertiary hospital in Santiago, Chile, between 2018 and 2022, subdivided into pre- (3/2018–2/2020) and post–COVID-19 onset (3/2020–2/2022), we evaluated intravenous AU and frequency of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE). We grouped monthly AU (defined daily doses [DDD]/1000 patient-days) into broad-spectrum β-lactams, carbapenems, and colistin and used interrupted time-series analysis to compare AU during pre- and post-pandemic onset. We studied the frequency of carbapenemase-producing (CP) CRE and performed whole-genome sequencing analyses of all carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKpn) isolates collected during the study period.Compared with pre-pandemic, AU (DDD/1000 patient-days) significantly increased after the pandemic onset, from 78.1 to 142.5 (P \\&lt; .001), 50.9 to 110.1 (P \\&lt; .001), and 4.1 to 13.3 (P \\&lt; .001) for broad-spectrum β-lactams, carbapenems, and colistin, respectively. The frequency of CP-CRE increased from 12.8\\% pre–COVID-19 to 51.9\\% after pandemic onset (P \\&lt; .001). The most frequent CRE species in both periods was CRKpn (79.5\\% and 76.5\\%, respectively). The expansion of CP-CRE harboring blaNDM was particularly noticeable, increasing from 40\\% (n = 4/10) before to 73.6\\% (n = 39/53) after pandemic onset (P \\&lt; .001). Our phylogenomic analyses revealed the emergence of two distinct genomic lineages of CP-CRKpn: ST45, harboring blaNDM, and ST1161, which carried blaKPC.AU and the frequency of CP-CRE increased after COVID-19 onset. The increase in CP-CRKpn was driven by the emergence of novel genomic lineages. Our observations highlight the need to strengthen infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship efforts.}",

    abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis is an emergent foodborne and zoonotic Salmonella serovar with critical implications for global health. In recent years, the prevalence of S. Infantis infections has increased in the United States, Europe, and Latin America, due to contaminated chicken and other foods. An essential trait of S. Infantis is its resistance to multiple antibiotics, including the critically important third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones, undermining effective medical treatment, particularly in low-resource settings. We describe the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. Infantis, focusing on humans, animals, the environment, and food. We conducted a systematic review (1979-2021), selected 183 studies, and analyzed the origin, source, antimicrobial resistance, and presence of a conjugative plasmid of emerging S. Infantis (pESI) in reported isolates. S. Infantis has been detected worldwide, with a substantial increase since 2011. We found the highest number of isolations in the Americas (42.9 %), Europe (29.8 %), Western Pacific (17.2 %), Eastern Mediterranean (6.6 %), Africa (3.4 %), and South-East Asia (0.1 %). S. Infantis showed MDR patterns and numerous resistant genes in all sources. The primary source of MDR S. Infantis is broiler and their meat; however, this emerging pathogen is also present in other reservoirs such as food, wildlife, and the environment. Clinical cases of MDR S. Infantis have been reported in children and adults. The global emergence of S. Infantis is related to a plasmid (pESI) with antibiotic and arsenic- and mercury-resistance genes. Additionally, a new megaplasmid (pESI-like), carrying blaCTX-M-65 and antibiotic-resistant genes reported in an ancestral version, was detected in the broiler, human, and chicken meat isolates. Strains harboring pESI-like were primarily observed in the Americas and Europe. MDR S. Infantis has spread globally, potentially becoming a major public health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.}
